# Dialogflow Firebase Function Resume

This repository contains the code for the Backend of my resume. My resume is a Google Assistant Service. The backend is hosted on Firebase Functions.

## Testing

You can test my service on Google Assistant. Currently it can only understand Dutch. To start the service, just say: "Spreek met het CV van Joachim".
